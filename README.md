# 🚀 Product Search App – Next.js + Tailwind + Firebase

This is a small personal project built to explore and practice the core technologies of **modern web development**, using:

- ✅ [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (App Router)
- ✅ [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for UI styling
- ✅ [Firebase Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore) as a NoSQL backend
- ✅ Deployed for free on [Vercel](https://vercel.com)

## 🎯 Project Goal

The main purpose of this app is **learning** and **experimentation** with:

- File-based routing and client-server interaction in Next.js
- Tailwind utility-first design
- Reading data from Firestore and rendering it in a search interface
- Deploying full-stack apps live using Vercel
